    <h1>About</h1>

    <p><i>Holybook</i> is a non-commercial project, whose aim is to provide a well-designed
        interface for searching and exploring the sacred texts of the world's religions.
        It will be provided free of charge and without advertisements at all times.
        The main code base of the project is open source. </p>

    <h3>Version</h3>

    <p>The current version of holybook is
        <strong>0.1</strong>. The current status represents a test version that includes
        only a small fraction of the writings of the Bahá'í Faith and only supports
        a very basic feature set such as searching and browsing the writings. The
        aim of this version is to provide a proof of concept that allows to test
        those basic features and decide on how to move on and what should be the
        next features.</p>

    <h3>Contribute</h3>

    <p>Currently the project is maintained by a single persion in his free time, but
        in the future it should be more and more community-driven. I would like to
        encourage everyone who thinks that this is a good project to contribute.
        Contribution is possible in the following ways:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Suggestions and Feedback: </strong>If you have any suggestions or feedback,
            please write a mail to <a href="mailto:feedback@holybook.ws?Subject=Feedback/Suggestions"
            target="_top">feedback@holybook.ws</a>. Please try to be constructive.
            At a later point, a forum will be set up to be able to discuss certain
            suggestions with the community.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Content acquisition: </strong>In order to be able to provide more sacred
            texts in a variety of languages, it is necessary to format these texts
            in a common <a href="https://github.com/holybook/api/blob/master/xml.md">XML format</a>
            that can be consumed by the holy book service. Most of the texts will
            be in public domain, but in order to ensure their authenticity, it would
            be desirable to receive them from a authoritative entity, such as a publisher,
            for example. At a later stage an optional digital signature mechanism
            will be implemented to provide a secure mechanism of asserting the authenticity
            of a text. If you
            <ul>
